# Recording-Sorter


The inspiration for this program comes from the fact that i record news broadcasts every day for later watching. But organizing the files manually isnt the most convinient thing, and they take up a lot of space. So my solution to that was making a program that creates a folder for the current month in the current year and re encodes the files using H265 in FFMPEG through the linux commandline (Bash)
